# Beer Choser
Randomly chooses a beer that is currently available at local LCBO (store ID: 511). Never duplicates its selection.
See demo [here](http://rpavlovs.me/beer-chooser/).

## Development

Clone the repo and run `npm start` to install dependancies and launch a local http server


## Notes

`lib/ui-bootstrap.js` is a dev version of Angular Bootstrap, that fixed tooltip flickering issues. This needs to changes as soon as UI Angular Bootstrap 0.14.0 is released.
